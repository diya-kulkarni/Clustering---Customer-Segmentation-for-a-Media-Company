# Clustering---Customer-Segmentation-for-a-Media-Company
In this project, I utilized two separate datasets on a media company's customers to create clusters that determined the different segments that the media company's customers belonged to.

**Key Highlights**
- Gained expertise in clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis.
- Identified distinct clusters based on variables like browsing time, ad click rate, and subscription length and curated recommendations tailored to each cluster.
- Recognized potential improvements in summarization methods and algorithm exploration for deeper insights.
